# [NDC Sydney](http://ndcsydney.com/) 1-5 August 2016

NDC started at a small developer conference in Norway in 2008, extended to London in 2013,
and I attended the first one in Sydney in 2016.
It has kept to it's roots as a small and friendly conference

I attended a two-day workshop before the conference, the three days of the conference,
and the tiny informal PubConf on the last evening. 

The recurring themes of the conference were:

- microservices
- serverless architecture
- .Net Core

The technical level of the talks and the audience was fairly high.
This is better than other conferences I've been to which have been at more of a beginner's level.

## [Workshop: Design and Implementation of Microservices](http://ndcsydney.com/workshop/design-and-implementation-of-microservices/)

This workshop was given by Sam Newman, the author of the authoratative book
[Building Microservices](http://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices/).

The slides for the workshop are available [here](http://bit.ly/ms-workshop).




## Notes to include somewhere in text

- Different range of tech - not just .Net
- Lots of talk about functional programming, but attendees didn't seem so impressed that they would actually use it
- Lots of talk about .Net Core, but still very much a 1.0 release
- Mention slow internet and Pokemon Go
- Not much talk about security in microservices, although it was mentioned, which is why the talk was disappointing

Microservice seems to be more of a concept and a buzzword than an actual thing
