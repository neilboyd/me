### [Whatâ€™s New in C#?](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2020/Whats-New-in-C)

- top level program
- `init` setter
  - serializer still breaks "read-only-ness", ie can set `init` properties
- `record`
  - class with value but no methods
  - nice `ToString` implementation
  - value equality
  - define properties in constructor
  - can be deconstruced (tuples)
  - probably immutable
- `with` expression - create (shallow) copy and have an extra object initialiser
- better pattern matching in switch statements

### [Porting Projects to .NET 5](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2020/Porting-Projects-to-NET-5)

- .Net 5 is not LTS - 6 will be
- Xamarin not in 5 - will be in 6
- everything they intend to bring from FF is now in .Net 5
  - AddDomains will not be ported, but can use AssemblyLoadContext instead
- .Net 5 replaces Core and Standard
  - also have platform specific versions that add stuff
  - cross platform libraries to support FF are still Standard 2.0
  - Standard 2.1 to share with Core 3.0 and Xamarin
- only reason to port is to innovate - Core 3.1 and FF will stay around for ever
- nice tools to migrate - `ApiPort` and `try-convert`

### [Setting Up Feature Flags with .NET](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2020/S236)

- using [Split](https://split.io/product/feature-flags/), not the .Net Core feature
- kill switch
- A/B testing
- subscription management
- canary release
- different differentiators: user, device, location, etc
- approval
- demo wasn't very good, but maybe she just wasn't a good presenter
- the product supports good best practises
