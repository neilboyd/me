# [NDC Sydney](http://ndcsydney.com/) 1-5 August 2016

NDC started at a small developer conference in Norway in 2008, extended to London in 2013,
and I attended the first one in Sydney in 2016.
It has kept to it's roots as a small and friendly conference

I attended a two-day workshop before the conference, the three days of the conference,
and the tiny informal PubConf on the last evening. 

The recurring themes of the conference were:

- microservices
- serverless architecture
- .Net Core

The technical level of the talks and the audience was fairly high.
This is better than other conferences I've been to which have been at more of a beginner's level.

## [Workshop: Design and Implementation of Microservices](http://ndcsydney.com/workshop/design-and-implementation-of-microservices/)

This workshop was given by Sam Newman, the author of the authoratative book
[Building Microservices](http://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices/).

The slides for the workshop are available [here](http://bit.ly/ms-workshop).

The workshop was about the theory and best practices of Microservices,
not about any specific implementations.


Write the highlights here

I could write a separate document with the details,
but maybe that's not worthwhile because I linked to the slides.

## [PubConf](http://pubconf.io/)

The conference ended with a series of light-hearted lightning talks in a pub.
The idea for PubConf came out of the philosophy "always do when you're sober what you say when you're drunk".
The format is 20 slides in 5 minutes.
There's one code of conduct rule: what happens in PubConf stays in PubConf.
That means no photos and no quotes.

The star of the conference, and of PubConf, was Troy Hunt.
He was the subject of many of the jokes,
and he gave a nice talk on the lighter side of security.

PubConf ended with music from Dylan Beattie who said
"two good things came out of Australia 40 years ago - Troy Hunt and AC/DC"
before playing a version of "[Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)"
to the tune of "Highway from Hell".
He also played his hilarious hit "[We're Gonna Build a Framework](http://www.dylanbeattie.net/2016/05/were-gonna-build-framework.html)".



## Notes to include somewhere in text

- Different range of tech - not just .Net
- Lots of talk about functional programming, but attendees didn't seem so impressed that they would actually use it
- Lots of talk about .Net Core, but still very much a 1.0 release
- Mention slow internet and Pokemon Go (perhaps I can mention this in keynote talk)
- Not much talk about security in microservices, although it was mentioned, which is why the talk was disappointing

Microservice seems to be more of a concept and a buzzword than an actual thing
